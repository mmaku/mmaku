Hi, I'm Michał Makowski, a machine learning passionate from Poland. I graduated from Mathematics at University of Wrocław. I had strong theoretical background in statistics and machine learning. I am interested in statistics in general, I am considering PhD in deep learning in the future.

During writing my master thesis I conduced research over novel method for precision matrix estimation in graphical models, and currently that's my greatest research achievement. I received two awards for this paper and it was widely appreciated by the academic audience. The thesis, as well as everything related to it, could be find in [graphical_SLOPE](https://github.com/mmaku/graphical_SLOPE) repo.

I am proficient in R and Python, having over 7 years academic experience in the former, the later being under my focus recently. I am working using mainly Tidyverse, pandas, NumPy and PyTorch libraries. I have minor experience in C++, C#, or VBA.

If you are looking for a team member for hackathon feel free to contact me, I open for such opportunities. I really enjoyed them in the past (with great achievements, too).
